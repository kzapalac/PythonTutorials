    "Often a data scientist is in need to think through a problem that a dataset might raise. Thinking data in abstract terms is not easy. But, Data Scientists are lucky because they know Python and can use the programming language to create data themselves. Creating data can help explore how the data might change or vary under different scenarios or hypothesis.\n",

    "For example, imagine having a complex and in important dataset in front of you, a very difficult problem, too much data and very noisy data. After plotting and describing the datasetand as we have done in Tutorials 7 and 8, the Data Scientist formulates an hypothesis about the dataset. Now the dataset is so big and noisy that working directly with the dataset is slow and tedious and access to better computing facility is not possible. So the Data Scientist thinks: \"Maybe I can generate a smaller dataset with the properties of the big dataset, just to thing through things and look at whether the pattern that the simulated dataset shows is similar to the big dataset i was given to study.\" Generating a dataset that is small and easy to work with and look at would really fcilitate the work of the Data Scientst. This process is called data simulation and we will explore more of this later in the course. For now let's think a specific example."

    "ADAS detected a large increase in heat and pollution on Earth by using a **Heat Sensitive Proxiscope (HeatSPro)**. The HeatSPro pattern follows the sun-light cycle, yet, the measurements show higher heat on earth than predicted by sunlight alone. The increase in heat goes just a little bit beyond what is predicted by the increase in heat due to the sunlight, and given how difficult it is to measure from hearth the measurements fade in. ADAS thinks this might be due to the activity of living organisms on earth that might be moving around and perhaps even burning elements on earth. ADAS hypothesizes that the discrepancy between the heat pattern predicted by the Sun cycle and the measurement could a first demonstration of life on earth. ADAS understands that each organism can only burn little and contribute very little to the HeatSPro measurements.  But ADAS thinks that if enough organisms exist on earth perhaps enough heat might be generated so that the pattern of heat measured by the HeatSPro might be explained by life on earth. \n",

    "After looking at the plot above ADAS thinks: \"OK that is it. I am correct. I am not going to do anything else. I think there is most likely life on earth. I am sure there are more than 10 organisms on earth, that sounds pretty reasonable. My calculations might be slight overestimates (especially regarding how much each indviidual contributes to heating the earth) but given how parsimonious I was with the other numbers (10 organisms only on a planet as big as the earth is? It must be more). So I belive this my hypothesis is confirmed!\" \n",

So, that said, I am now happy with my simulations and I am going to go back to work on HeatSPro. I need more samples of data to make sure the pattern I can simulate actually exists in the data!\" \"There is life on earth!!\" ADAS concludes."
